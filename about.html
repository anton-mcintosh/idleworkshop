        Hey there! It's nice to see you today. I'm Anton, and i've been working on
        my Computer Science degree from Western Washington University. I really
        like to build things both digital and in the physical world. This
        website is just another one of those things. As time goes on i'll be
        adding projects and blog posts as well as sharing some of my travel
        adventures.

        If you're in the software industry and think there might be a place in
        your business for a rookie engineer such as myself, take a look at my
        <a href="Anton_s_Resume.pdf">resume</a>! <br />

        Thanks for stopping by!</pre>
